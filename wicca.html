                        <h2>What is Wicca?</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Wicca is a modern pagan religion that emphasizes harmony with nature, personal spirituality,
                            and
                            reverence for the divine. It's often associated with practices like ritual magick,
                            herbalism,
                            and
                            worship of goddesses and gods, but typically at least follow mother Goddess and/or the
                            Horned
                            God.
                            Wiccans typically celebrate seasonal festivals called Sabbats and conduct ceremonies known
                            as
                            rituals to
                            honor their beliefs and connect with the spiritual forces they believe in!

                        <h2>Mother Goddess</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In Wicca, the Mother Goddess is like the big cosmic mama figure. She's often seen as the
                            embodiment of
                            fertility, wisdom, and nurturing energy. Think of her as this divine force that's all about
                            creation and
                            the cycles of life. The Mother Goddess is celebrated in various forms depending on the
                            tradition, like
                            the Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, Crone), or specific goddesses from different mythologies
                            like Isis,
                            Diana, or Hecate. Basically, she's the ultimate divine feminine presence in Wiccan belief.
                            <br>
                            Personally I practice with the Triple Goddess, more so than any specific deity. The closest,
                            I
                            suppose
                            entity, that I work with is my Spirit Guides, who I'll discuss later.

                        <h2>The Horned God</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Wiccans often worship the Mother Goddess alongside the Horned God, her partner, representing
                            the
                            masculine side of things.
                            <br>
                            He's often depicted as this powerful figure with horns on his head, hence the name. Picture
                            him
                            as the
                            embodiment of the wild, untamed energy of nature, kind of like the spirit of the forest or
                            the
                            hunt.
                            He's associated with masculinity, virility, and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Some
                            Wiccans see
                            him as the god of the wild animals, the hunt, and even fertility.
                            <br>
                            Like the Mother Goddess, the Horned God has different forms and aspects depending on the
                            tradition.
                            Sometimes he's linked with specific gods from ancient mythologies, like Pan, Cernunnos, or
                            even
                            the
                            Green Man. In Wiccan belief he's like the rugged, primal force of nature.

                        <p>
                            So, everyone has at least 1 spirit guide. Think of them as mentors from the other side,
                            offering advice, protection, and wisdom when we need it most. They're believed to be
                            entities—sometimes ancestors, angels, or even animals—that guide and support us throughout
                            our lives. You can get signs from them, as well as communicate with them with numerous
                            different methods, and generally ask for their help and guidance throughout your life. Some
                            people also sense their presence, while others may receive messages or guidance through
                            dreams or intuition.
                            <br><br>
                            Personally I have a little altar set up for them. I give them offerings of food
                            occasionally, or an object that ends up takeing residency there. I have a candle I light for
                            them everyday, and in turn is usually lit while I'm studying. This is because I feel like
                            their presence is stronger with the candle lit and feels like support in my endevers.
                            <br><br>
                            I always say good morning and good night to them and thank them for their job. When I want
                            to communicate or gain some guidance, I use a tarot deck and just shuffle until a card flies
                            out, 'the one they've picked'. They looooove to call me out on things that I should be doing
                            but also give great advice. I also use a pendulum, coin toss, or watch the flame to flicker
                            when asking yes or no questions.
                            <br><br>
                            To conclude, love them a bunch and are a super big part of my practice.

                        <h2>Witchcraft</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In Wicca, witchcraft is basically the magical side of things. It's all about tapping into
                            the
                            natural
                            energies of the universe to create change or achieve certain goals. Wiccans often see magic
                            as a
                            way to
                            work with the rhythms of nature and the divine forces around them.
                            <br><br>
                            Witchcraft in Wicca involves rituals, spells, and ceremonies that are designed to align with
                            the
                            cycles
                            of the moon, the seasons, and other natural phenomena. It's about about focusing your
                            intentions
                            and
                            energy to bring about the outcomes you desire.
                            <br><br>
                            Typically being wiccan and doing witchcraft, aka also making you a witch, come hand in hand.
                            But
                            that's
                            not always the case. You can be wiccan without needing to do witchcraft, just as much as you
                            can
                            be a
                            witch and not follow a faith; for witchcraft is a practice not a religion.
                            <br><br>
                            Also to add upon this, society typically thinks that witches are only female due to the
                            multitude of
                            medias portraying this narrative. But, being a witch is not prescribed to any gender,
                            female,
                            male, nonbinary, or anthying else in between.

                            over all the over arching theme is:

                            Spells can be super elaborate with the works, or be as simple as stirring your coffee
                            clockwise
                            with the
                            intention of having a good day.
                            <br><br>
                            Spells can technically be doen whenever, but we try to plan them around a certain time to
                            get the best impact from them.
                            <br><br>
                            Having and fully believing the intention will work is what will make your spell workout.

                        <p>
                            For me the easiest way to manifest is by:
                            <br><br>
                            At the end the night, looking out my window and at the moon, if possible, and recount
                            everything
                            I'm grateful/excited for. Whilst
                            recounting, I incorporate things that I want to happen in my life, also stating timelines
                            and
                            being as
                            detailed as possible. By saying things thta are true and exist with things you wish for, it
                            gives the energy of it has already occurred, therefore will happen for you.
                            <br>
                            Make sure you feel the emotions from the result of the thing you want. Feel it with your
                            soul and body and know it will happen. Yes, this feels delusional at first, but once you
                            start
                            beleiving it, trust me, it works.
                            <br><br>
                            This funnily enough is how I ended up manifesting myself a boyfriend as well as a good chunk
                            of beneficial opportunites/lessons.

                        <p>
                            To make a simple abundance oil, you just add any herb you personally associate with
                            abundance/the
                            item you want abundance of in a jar with an oil that's also associated with the intention.

                            and let it sit in the sun for a week. This is the basic outline for making an oil based
                            spell.

                            can be applied on the skin or items or whatever you'd like. Make sure you believe it will
